# Linear Regression Analysis

## Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique that models the relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of both simple and multiple linear regression using Python.

## Features

- **Simple Linear Regression:** Implement and understand the simplest form of linear regression involving two variables.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Explore how multiple features can be used to predict a response.
- **Model Evaluation:** Utilize metrics like R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and MSE to evaluate the model.
- **Prediction:** Use the model to make predictions on new data.
- **Visualization:** Plot the results using libraries such as Matplotlib.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, you will need some packages, which you can install using pip:
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib sklearn
To run the model, navigate to the `src` directory and execute the following command:
python linear_regression.py

## Detailed Code Explanation

1. **Data Loading:**
   - `dataset.csv` is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Example: `data = pd.read_csv('../data/dataset.csv')`

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values, if any.
   - Splitting data into features and labels.
   - Normalizing/scaling the features if required.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Example: `train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`

3. **Model Training:**
   - Creating a linear regression model instance from a library like sklearn.
   - Fitting this model on the training data.
   - Example: `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`

4. **Model Testing:**
   - Predicting the responses for the test dataset using the trained model.
   - Example: `predictions = model.predict(X_test)`

5. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Calculating and printing various performance metrics such as R-squared, MSE, etc.
   - Example: `print('R-squared:', r2_score(y_test, predictions))`

6. **Visualization:**
   - Using Matplotlib to create plots showing the actual vs predicted values or the regression line.
   - Example: `plt.scatter(X_test, y_test); plt.plot(X_test, predictions, color='red'); plt.show()`
